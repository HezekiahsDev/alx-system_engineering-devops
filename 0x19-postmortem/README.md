# Postmortem: The Day KryptX Payment Gateway Went on a Coffee Break 

## Issue Summary:
Duration: 2 hours and 45 minutes, from 11:00 AM to 1:45 PM GMT on August 12, 2024.
Impact: KryptX Payment Gateway, the lifeline for USDT transactions on Binance Smart Chain (BSC), decided to take an unscheduled coffee break. During this time, 80% of users were locked out of transactions, while the other 20% experienced frustratingly slow service—think of trying to get coffee from a barista who’s only half-awake.
Root Cause: A sneaky misconfiguration in our smart contract triggered excessive gas fees, causing transactions to fail. And just when we thought we fixed it, we accidentally turned the coffee machine off entirely with a buggy hotfix.

## Timeline: The Play-by-Play of the Coffee Fiasco
11:00 AM: Monitoring alerts start pinging like crazy, signaling a surge in transaction failures. Picture the fire alarm going off, but instead of fire, it’s a coffee machine spitting out empty cups.\n
11:05 AM: Our engineers race to the blockchain explorer, assuming it’s just BSC’s morning rush hour. Nope, no luck there.\n
11:15 AM: We think, “It’s gotta be the network!”—so we try rerouting transactions to different nodes. That’s like trying to order from another barista, but the line’s just as long.\n
11:30 AM: Smart contract devs get tagged in. The culprit? Gas fees that went through the roof, like trying to order a simple black coffee but getting charged for a triple-shot caramel macchiato with extra foam.\n
12:00 PM: We deploy a hotfix, hoping to cool things down, but instead, we shut down the coffee machine altogether. Now, nobody’s getting any coffee—or transactions.\n
12:30 PM: Rollback time! We bring the old setup back, but things are still grinding like stale coffee beans.\n
1:00 PM: Finally, we pinpoint the issue: a misconfigured gas limit in the smart contract, basically a clogged coffee filter. We get it sorted out, clean the machine, and fire it back up.\n
1:45 PM: Success! The coffee flows, err, transactions process smoothly again, and the caffeine-deprived masses rejoice.\n

## Root Cause and Resolution: Cleaning the Coffee Filter
Turns out, the real culprit was a misconfigured gas limit in our smart contract—kind of like setting your coffee machine to use just one scoop of grounds when you need three. Transactions were failing left and right because the gas fees were too high, causing the blockchain equivalent of a burnt brew.
Here’s how we fixed it:
We reconfigured the smart contract’s gas limit to match the complexity of our transactions—no more weak coffee.
We tested it thoroughly, ensuring that every type of transaction was processed smoothly.
We redeployed the corrected smart contract, making sure it could handle the full caffeine load without breaking down.

## Corrective and Preventative Measures: Avoiding Future Coffee Breaks
What We Learned:
Monitoring: We’re enhancing our alerts to catch gas fee spikes before they start burning our brew.
Testing: Our smart contracts will now undergo rigorous testing under different conditions, including the caffeine-deprived, Monday morning scenario.
Deployment: We’ve added a “don’t mess up the coffee machine” step to our deployment process—testing hotfixes in a staging environment before serving them to the masses.

## Tasks:
Patch the smart contract to dynamically adjust gas fees based on transaction complexity—think of it as a smart coffee machine that knows when you need an extra shot.
Set up new alerts for gas fee anomalies—so we catch them before they spill over.
Enhance our CI/CD pipeline with tests for every conceivable scenario, including “What if the coffee machine breaks?”
Train our team on blockchain troubleshooting, so next time, we can get back to brewing in no time.
Implement a rollback procedure that lets us undo changes without shutting down the coffee machine.

In short, we’ve learned our lesson: keep an eye on the coffee machine (aka smart contract), and make sure it’s brewing just right. After all, nobody likes a coffee break that lasts too long—especially when it means your transactions are stuck in line.
